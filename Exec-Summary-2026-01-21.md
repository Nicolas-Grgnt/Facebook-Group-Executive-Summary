## Executive summary (past 24 hours across the mixed threads)

### 1) Guesty: product reliability + trust issues are dominating discussion
- **iPhone app appears severely broken for at least some users**: one host reported the updated app is “useless” beyond messaging—**gray screens** when opening reservations/contact info and **calendar date selection errors** (selecting Sept 14 enters Sept 12). Guesty reportedly advised using the **mobile browser instead of the app**, which users view as an unacceptable workaround.
- **Possible notification delivery issues**: a commenter said they **almost missed a major booking** because they weren’t getting notifications and only saw it after manually checking the app.

**Impact:** risk of missed bookings, inability to manage operations on mobile, and rising frustration with support responses.

### 2) Guesty Lite: VA access and permissions are a security/ops pain point (active within ~20h)
- A host asked how to safely give a **virtual assistant (VA)** access to Guesty Lite without full control, after support allegedly said **added users get the same permissions as the owner** (including security/bank changes and even the ability to remove the owner).
- Responses indicate **“you really can’t”** do granular access in Lite; suggestions included:
  - Don’t do it / **switch PMS**,
  - **Use a highly trusted VA** only,
  - **Upgrade** to a version that may support better role controls.

**Impact:** elevated fraud/lockout risk and operational bottlenecks for owners trying to delegate.

### 3) Guesty: churn signals and support/accessibility complaints
- One thread focused on **how to cancel Guesty**: a user said **account rep emails bounce** and they don’t know who their manager is. Guidance offered: cancel via settings, try LinkedIn, contact US office/market manager—but the poster pushed back hard and compared Guesty unfavorably to **Hospitable** (cheaper/better in their view).
- Another post asked about **contract cancellation periods**; one reply advised using **privacy.com** to block billing (reflecting high dissatisfaction, though it’s not a formal/clean resolution).

**Impact:** ongoing reputational damage + escalation risk around billing/contract disputes.

### 4) Delegation/outsourcing: demand for VAs and automation (plus vendor promotion)
- A separate Guesty thread asked for **VA service recommendations**; suggestions included **CS Outsource** and **STR Kyrios** (and others offering to DM).
- A vendor founder promoted an **AI co-host (Lillah AI)** launching on Guesty Pro, offering **3 beta spots** with **1 year free**; at least one host expressed interest.

**Takeaway:** strong appetite to offload messaging/ops—made more urgent by Lite permission limits and app instability.

---

### 5) Other Guesty operational topics (lower volume in this batch)
- **Damage protection strategy**: discussion compared **security deposits** vs **GuestyShield** (pros: guest-friendly claims process; cons: cost per reservation / required on all reservations).
- **Cohost / PMS connection constraint**: comment reiterated you can only connect **one Airbnb account to one PMS**.
- **Direct booking websites**: requests for examples; consensus that Guesty’s builder “works but is limited,” with multiple people sharing external/custom options.
- **Privacy/scam prevention reminder**: warning to **mask ID/document numbers** when posting found IDs/licenses.

---

## 6) Smoobu: price increases, support frustration, and feature gaps
- **+23% annual invoice increase** triggered a “done with Smoobu” post; complaints included a **crappy dashboard**, UI issues (lists falling off screen), and missing/changed **multilingual** functionality.
- Comments echoed **poor support responsiveness** and explored alternatives (notably **Lodgify**, but concern about redirecting users during booking).
- Additional recurring pain points in the included threads:
  - **New website builder**: users seeking tutorials; others report migration is difficult; domain hosting/config (e.g., Strato) appears problematic.
  - **Dynamic pricing doubts**: one new user tested it and saw **no bookings** vs their usual performance; another user said they use **PriceLabs** instead.
  - **Invoicing permissions/automation concerns**: report that cleaners may be able to create/view invoices regardless of team settings; invoicing seen as **manual and error-prone** (VAT, numbering, sending).
  - **Considering switching to V-Office**: interest, but unclear fit; speculation that vOffice may require **30+ properties**, plus mention of a “smaller v-office” option.

---

### 7) Non-operational noise
- A couple of **“welcome new members”** posts (e.g., BYD E2 Uruguay) with no substantive discussion.

## What matters most right now (priority signals)
1. **Guesty iOS app reliability + notification failures** are creating immediate operational risk (missed bookings, inability to manage calendars/reservations).
2. **Guesty Lite’s lack of safe delegated access** is pushing owners toward risky workarounds, upgrades, or switching platforms.
3. **Smoobu pricing + support + web builder/invoicing friction** continues to fuel churn exploration and comparisons to alternatives.
