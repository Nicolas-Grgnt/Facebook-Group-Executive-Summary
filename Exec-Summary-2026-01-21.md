# Executive Summary (Past 24 Hours)

## Top Themes & Sentiment
- **High frustration with PMS tools (Guesty + Smoobu)** driven by **app bugs, permission/security gaps, price increases, and weak support responsiveness**.
- Strong undercurrent of **“considering switching”** (Guesty ↔ competitors like Hospitable; Smoobu ↔ Lodgify/V-Office).
- Community discussions focused on **workarounds**, **risk mitigation**, and **vendor alternatives** rather than feature adoption.

---

## Guesty Users Group — Key Updates

### 1) Guesty iPhone App Issues (Operational Impact)
- Multiple users reported the **new iOS app version is effectively unusable** beyond messaging:
  - Gray screens when opening reservations/contact info.
  - Calendar date selection errors (selecting one date inputs another).
  - Potential **notification failures**, nearly causing a missed booking.
- Guesty support reportedly advised using the **mobile browser instead of the app**, which users called an unacceptable workaround.

**Why it matters:** This is a direct **day-to-day ops risk** (missed bookings, inability to manage calendars/blocks on mobile).

---

### 2) Guesty Lite + VA Access = Full-Privilege Risk
- A host asked how to safely give a **Virtual Assistant access in Guesty Lite** without admin-level permissions.
- Responses indicated:
  - **No true secondary/limited-permission logins** in Lite.
  - Risk includes **bank/security changes** and even **account owner removal**.
  - Suggested “solutions” were essentially: **don’t do it**, **switch PMS**, **hire only highly trusted VAs**, or **upgrade tier**.

**Why it matters:** This is a **security/compliance risk** for anyone outsourcing guest comms or operations.

---

### 3) Churn/Offboarding Friction + Support/Account Rep Gaps
- A user trying to stop paying/cancel reported **account rep emails bouncing** and not knowing who their manager is.
- Community guidance: cancel via platform settings; try LinkedIn/market manager; debate followed with criticism that Guesty is costly and disconnected, with **Hospitable** cited as cheaper/better.

**Why it matters:** Offboarding friction increases **brand damage** and accelerates **public churn narratives**.

---

### 4) Outsourcing & Tooling Requests
- Request for **VA services compatible with Guesty** drew recommendations including:
  - **CS Outsource**
  - **STR Kyrios (May Lpt)**
  - Others offering to share privately and clarifying what tasks to offload.

---

### 5) Risk/Policy Discussions: Damage Protection
- Community compared approaches across channels:
  - **Security deposits** (e.g., $500 for Vrbo/direct) vs platform protections like AirCover.
  - **GuestyShield** praised for ease/guest experience but criticized as **pricey** and **required on all reservations**.
  - Practical workaround for longer stays: **manual re-authorization in Stripe** after 7 days.

---

### 6) Direct Booking Site Positioning
- Users requested examples of **Guesty direct booking sites**; feedback suggested:
  - Guesty builder “works” but has **limited design/layout flexibility**.
  - Vendors promoted **fully custom direct booking sites** (separate from Guesty constraints).
  - Side chatter included direct-booking marketing mentions (e.g., Boostly).

---

### 7) Vendor Promotion / Beta Recruiting
- A founder promoted an **AI co-host messaging tool** preparing to launch on **Guesty Pro**, recruiting a small beta (free first year); at least one user expressed interest.

---

## Smoobu User Group — Key Updates

### 1) Pricing Shock + Product/UI Complaints
- One user reported **+23% annual invoice increase** and criticized:
  - “Crappy” new dashboard
  - UI issues (lists falling off screen)
  - Loss/regression of multilingual functionality on the website

**Sentiment:** “Bye Smoobu” / switching intent.

---

### 2) Support Responsiveness & Alternative Shopping
- Support described as **slow/non-responsive**.
- Alternatives discussed:
  - **Lodgify** considered, but disliked due to **redirecting users to Lodgify during booking** (website integration concern).
  - **V-Office** raised as a comparison; belief that it may require **30+ properties**, though a “small v-office” option was linked.

---

### 3) Website Builder Migration Confusion
- Users asked for **step-by-step tutorials** for the new website builder; response: none found and the process is difficult.
- Separate thread: challenges hosting the new Smoobu website on certain domains (e.g., Strato); users reported struggling with support and even switching hosts without resolution.

---

### 4) Invoicing/E-Invoice Concerns (Permissions + Automation)
- Reported issue: **cleaners can create/view invoices regardless of team permissions** (seen as a bug/regression).
- Strong criticism of invoicing workflow:
  - Manual invoice initiation
  - Manual VAT corrections
  - Manual invoice numbering
  - Partial/incorrect data pull and manual email extraction for sending
- Follow-up questions raised about **German e-invoice compliance** and whether automation is possible (some previously used Lexoffice connectors).

---

### 5) Dynamic Pricing Disappointment
- New user testing Smoobu’s dynamic pricing reported a sharp drop in bookings vs normal seasonality.
- Only concrete alternative mentioned: **PriceLabs**.

---

## Other Group Activity (Low Operational Relevance)
- **BYD E2 Uruguay**: simple “welcome new member” posts.
- **Uruguay rentals group**: post seeking a retired couple to camp for free in exchange for garden maintenance (not PMS-related).

---

## Key Risks / Action Items (for Operators)
- **Guesty iOS app:** advise teams to monitor bookings via desktop/web and set secondary notification checks until confirmed stable; risk of missed bookings.
- **Guesty Lite permissions:** treat VA access as high-risk; consider alternate workflows (shared inbox outside Guesty, or upgrading/changing PMS if delegation is required).
- **Smoobu cost increases + support gaps:** expect more churn conversations; operators should re-evaluate ROI and confirm website/invoicing roadmap before renewing.
- **Smoobu invoicing permissions:** anyone using team roles should audit who can access invoices and restrict operational exposure where possible.
